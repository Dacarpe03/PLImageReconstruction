\section{SLM Reconstruction}
    This section contains information about the models and notebooks used to reconstruc SLM data.
    
	\subsection{Data}
		The data consists of 90000 complex fields generated with an SLM in the LAB, each datapoint is a 96x96x2 matrix containing information from data and phase of the complex field.\\
		
		The corresponding 90000 output fluxes of the photonic lantern have the shape of a 19 element vector.\\
		
		The data is from Barnaby's morgana folders that start with the prefix \\ \filename{slmcube\_20230625\_complsines-01sp\_07\_PSFWFs\_file}
	
	\subsection{Results}
		The best results obtained are with a flux autoencoder and a convolutional neural network to decode the flux into amplitude and phase.
