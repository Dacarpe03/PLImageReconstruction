		After seeing that with 1 datapoint the model does not learn I decide to make some simpler tests, I will train a model that from a 19 element array predicts images with 2 channels and see if the input is too small for the model to predict anything. Three experiments will be performed:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item From a 19 elements array to a 2x128x128 image
			\item From a 19 elements array to a 2x64x64 image
			\item From a 19 elements array to a 2x32x32 image
		\end{itemize}
	}
	
	\input{Experiments/psf-FromArrayToImage128}
	
	\action{
		From the previous experiment it is clear that a 19 element array as input is enough to reconstruct a random image of 2x128x128 resolution, what is happening for the psf reconstruction?.\\
		
		I will perform the other 2 stated experiments because it is quite fast.
	}

		The results are satisfactory, I am going to try the exact same configuration for one data point of the PSF dataset and see what happens	
	}
	
	\input{Experiments/psf-TestWith1DataPoint-3}
	\action{
		The result has improved incredibly compared to the TestWith1DataPoint-1 and TestWith1DataPoint-2. The only difference I can see are the learning rates and the batch size. I will perform a series of experiments varying batch size: 100 datapoints with 64, 32 and 16 batch size
