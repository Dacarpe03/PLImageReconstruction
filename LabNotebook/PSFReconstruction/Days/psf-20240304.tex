		After seeing that with 1 datapoint the model does not learn I decide to make some simpler tests, I will train a model that from a 19 element array predicts images with 2 channels and see if the input is too small for the model to predict anything. Three experiments will be performed:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item From a 19 elements array to a 2x128x128 image
			\item From a 19 elements array to a 2x64x64 image
			\item From a 19 elements array to a 2x32x32 image
		\end{itemize}
	}
