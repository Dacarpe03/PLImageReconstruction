	\action{Regularizations:
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Dropout, the best results altough not enough
			\item Batch normalization makes the convergence faster but makes overfitting worse
			\item Kernel regularizers, they don't help, the model does not learn.
		\end{itemize}

	\action{Apart from the overfitting, the predictions made from the training samples are accurate but just in the center of the pupil, as we go away from the center the ripples become more regular}
	
	\action{My guess is either we need more fibers on the PL or a lower resolution image}
