	\action{PL information determination}
	
	\action{Given some set of data containing the inputs (eg mode coeffs or images) X and outputs (eg PL fluxes) y of a photonic lantern, quantify the amount of information preserved by the encoding, independent of any assumptions about the transfer function or reconstruction algorithm.}
	
	\action{First create files with the predictions from the models \filename{PSFRecontructorSuperBigFC70000-1} (for the original sized complex fields predictions) and \filename{CroppedBNFC70000-1} (for the cropped complex fields predictions). The predictions are made for the whole train dataset.}
	
	\action{\textbf{BRUTE FORCE ANALYSIS}:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Pick 70000 random pair of frames
			\item Save euclidean distances for each of them
			\item Plot euclidean distances
			\item See if PSF similarity implies PL similarity
			\item Metric will be the ratio between PL output distances and PSF distances
			\item Perform ANOVA test for Uncropped, Cropped, PredictedUncropped, PredictedCropped pairs.
		\end{itemize}
