		Since in yesterdays experiment the model does not learn at all, I design two different experiments, to check if there is a problem with the network:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item A model that sums the output flux of the PL
			\item A model that sums the scalars of the complex numbers array containing the electric fields at the pupil.
		\end{enumerate}
