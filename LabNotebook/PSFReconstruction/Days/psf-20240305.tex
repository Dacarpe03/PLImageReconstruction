		Apart from the mse, no significant difference can be appreciated for different batch sizes using 100 datapoints.

		The goal for today is to study the correlation between the L2 norm of the pupil plane electric field and the L2 norm of the LP modes complex coefficients.
	}
		
	\action{
		First compute the L2 norm of the LP modes complex coefficients from the validation psf electric fields.

		Done!, here it is what it looks like

	\action{
		Let's do the same for the electric fields of the PSF

	\action{
		Done!, here are the results:

	\action{
		After doing a correlation analysis the result is the following:\\
		\filename{Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.1451513895198259}\\
		Which means that there is no correlation
