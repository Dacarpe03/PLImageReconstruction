		Apart from the mse, no significant difference can be appreciated for different batch sizes using 100 datapoints.

	\action{
		The goal of today is to study the correlation between the L2 norm of the pupil plane electric field and the L2 norm of the LP modes complex coefficients.
	}
	\action{
		First compute the L2 norm of the LP modes complex coefficients from the validation psf electric fields.

		Done!, here it is what it looks like
