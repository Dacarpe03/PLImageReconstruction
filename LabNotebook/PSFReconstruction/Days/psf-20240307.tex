		I will test a  model with the new generated unnormalized output fluxes
	}
	
	\input{Experiments/psf-UnnormalizedCoefficients-1}
	
	\action{
		Looks like the problem with the data was in the normalization of the coefficients, I will reprocess the output fluxes again and then test with a bigger dataset.	
	}
	
	\action{
		While, the processing is running I create two new functions to plot, amplitude-phase-intensity and output flux of the PL.
