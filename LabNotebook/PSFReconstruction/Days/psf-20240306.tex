	\action{Today I will be looking at the code from the \filename{lantern\_fiber\_utils.py} file looking for the place where the LP mode coefficients are normalized}
	
	\action{Found it, in the function \filename{make\_fiber\_modes()} used to compute de coefficients, there is a parameter called \filename{normtosum} that is set to True by default, it looks as it normalizes the coefficients after the overlap integral is computed.}
		
	\action{Set \filename{normtosum} to False, and compute 10000 output fluxes.}
