\section{The data}

	\subsection{Zernike coefficients dataset}
			A dataset of 3200 zernike coefficients is created for this report.In particular, each datapoint represent the coefficients of the first 5 Zernike modes, their values ranging between:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item The first 2 modes between[-2, -1.8] and [1.8, 2].
				\item Modes 4, 5 and 6 between [-1, -0.8] and [0.8, 1]
			\end{itemize}			 
			These ranges create 32 original clusters that will be used as reference.
			
	\subsection{PSFs intensities dataset}
		
		A dataset of 3200 PSFs is created using the Zernike coefficients dataset.\\
		
	\subsection{LP mode coefficients dataset}
		A dataset of 3200 LP mode coefficients obtained from computing the overlap integral of the first 19 LP modes with the PSF dataset.
		
	\subsection{LP mode coefficients dataset}
		A dataset of 3200 PL output fluxes obtained from the PL transfer matrix and LP coefficients.
