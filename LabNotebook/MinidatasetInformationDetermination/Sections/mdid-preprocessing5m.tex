\section{Preprocessing}

	\subsection{PSF Intensities}
		The 3200x128x128 array is dimensionally reduced using PCA and UMAP both giving an array of 3200x19 projections of the PSF Intensities.
		
	\subsection{LP Coefficients}
		The 3200x19x2 array is dimensionally reduced using PCA and UMAP both giving an array of 3200x2 projections of the original LP coefficients.
		
	\subsection{Output fluxes}
		The 3200x19 array is dimensionally reduced using PCA and UMAP both giving an array of 3200x2 projections of the original LP coefficients.
